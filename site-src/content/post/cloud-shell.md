## Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and infrastructure, from any web browser. It’s instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account—no other installation is needed. In the IBM Cloud console, click the IBM Cloud Shell icon ![IBM Cloud Shell icon](https://dsc.cloud/quickshare/terminal-cloud-shell.svg). A session starts and automatically logs you in through the IBM Cloud CLI. You can open up to five concurrent sessions, which operate independently so you can work with different resources, regions, and accounts at once.

> Note: Your Cloud Shell workspace includes 500 MB of temporary secure storage, which you can access through your personal home directory, `/home/<user-name>`. If you're idle in Cloud Shell for over an hour, your files and data are removed.
